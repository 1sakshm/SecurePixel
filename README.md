# 🔐 SecurePixel - Image ↔ Audio Converter

SecurePixel is a **client-side encryption tool** that allows you to securely **convert images into audio files (WAV)** and then **restore them back** to their original form.  
All processing happens directly in your browser (using JavaScript), ensuring **privacy** and **no server uploads**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🛡️ **Military-Grade Security** – Data is compressed and encoded before embedding in audio.  
- ⚡ **Fast Processing** – Works entirely in your browser with optimized algorithms.  
- 🌐 **No Server Required** – 100% offline, nothing leaves your device.  
- 💫 **Lossless Quality** – The decrypted image is exactly the same as the original.  
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Stylish gradient background, floating particles, and animations.

## 📸 How It Works

### 🔒 **Encryption (Image → Audio)**
1. **Read the Image File**  
   The selected image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF) is loaded as raw binary data.

2. **Extract Metadata**  
   Image dimensions (width & height) are extracted and stored for later reconstruction.

3. **Compression**  
   The raw image data is **compressed using [pako.js (zlib/deflate)](https://github.com/nodeca/pako)**.

4. **Metadata + Data Encoding**  
   A string is formed:  IMGDATA:<width>:<height>:<base64 compressed data>

This ensures the audio file knows how to restore the image.

5. **Convert to Bytes**  
The string is converted into a `Uint8Array`.

6. **Create WAV File**  
A custom WAV file is generated:
- Sample rate: 8000 Hz  
- Channels: Mono  
- Bit depth: 8-bit  
- Data chunk stores the encoded byte stream.  

7. **Result**  
A downloadable `.wav` file is provided.  

---

### 🔓 **Decryption (Audio → Image)**
1. **Read WAV File**  
The encrypted `.wav` is parsed and raw audio bytes are extracted.

2. **Extract Data String**  
The audio bytes are decoded back into a UTF-8 string.

3. **Validate Format**  
The tool checks that the data starts with the `IMGDATA:` marker.

4. **Parse Metadata**  
Extracts:
- Width  
- Height  
- Base64 encoded compressed data  

5. **Decompression**  
Base64 data → Binary buffer → Decompressed using **pako.inflate**.

6. **Rebuild Image**  
The decompressed binary is wrapped in a `Blob` with `type: image/png`.

7. **Result**  
The image is displayed on screen and can be downloaded in its original form.

## 💡 Notes
- The WAV files generated by this tool are **not playable audio**, but structured binary containers.  
- Only WAV files **generated by SecurePixel** can be decrypted correctly.
